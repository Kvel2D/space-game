TODO

current thoughts:
	attaching parts is a pain, either make auto attach the default or reduce how often you need to attach parts
	currently there's a bit too much attaching between flying, also the ship feels like it's not big enough,
	enlarge the ship canvas 

ship color selection

figure out cargo size as related to item weights

make higher level planets produce significantly more resources
and higher level stations cost much more

drones
	crafted in assembly station, not an actual item
	proceeds to move between closest planet and assembly station, carrying materials

optimize rendering of parts and ship
	create image for each part
	recycle images, when part is attached, push to array and maybe reuse
	keep an image for ship
		add to image when attaching parts
		draw pixel by pixel during flying
		remove at the end of flying

BUGS

splitting has bugs, splitting while typing in number is weird

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
DONE

planet name generation
add checks for ui interaction conflicts
rename planet type to planet level
fix bug when installing station from planet inventory
add "active" flag for items, items in planet inventories off-screen are inactive and can't be accessed
planet levels, affect how much resources mining stations can mine
mining station levels, need mining station to be same as planet level to actually mine more
switch planet levels, 1 = dry planet, 2 = mostly water, 3 = medium
right click moves part to random ship edit area(connected to ship)
recenter viewport after flying
crafting menu slider
weight for different level stations
fix mining stations adding materials to all material items in inventory, not just one
fix part border not turning white when touching ship

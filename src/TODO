TODO


planet name generator

optimize rendering of parts and ship
	create image for each part
	recycle images, when part is attached, push to array and maybe reuse

keep an image for ship
	add to image when attaching parts
	draw pixel by pixel during flying
	remove at the end of flying

no planet inventory without a station

planets have levels, higher level planets produce more resources(can be seen in tooltip, next to remote inventory)
	3 station levels, planet level must be at least equal to station level to install

figure out cargo size as related to item weights

BUGS AND ISSUES

need to reset dragging state when flying, currently there are no error checks

dragging and splitting shouldn't intersect, disable one while doing the other


---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
DONE

planets viewport and culling
planet position generation
cull planet interactions for planets behind ui
flying damage scales based on flying time, happens in bursts
flying time scales based on distance between planets
